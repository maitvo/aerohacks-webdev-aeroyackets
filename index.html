			<h2>Project: QuadDropper</h2>
			<h2>Slogan: Two Birds, One Drone</h2>
			<p id = "description">The QuadDropper is a sophisticated design for a payload bay mount that houses a small, foldable drone for deployment at peak apogee. The bay opens with the help of a motorized pin system and allows the drone to expand to its full dimensions. This system allows the drone to be carried to high altitudes without wasting battery to reach maximum height.</p>
